# Interpolate GPS data to regular time interval, either downsampling, or upsampling
# when gaps in data exist


# Load in the filtered trip data (from trip_departure_decision_filter.R)


# Take a sub-set of these for initial testing


# Get GPS point data for these trips


# Make these into ltraj thing from adehabitat
# Think can treat each trip as a 'burst'


# Initially on one trip...

# Process with redisltraj from adehabitatLT
# Try 600 s initially - or maybe even 300 s???
